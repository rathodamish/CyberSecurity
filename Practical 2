# Vulnerability Scanning using Nikto in Kali Linux

### Nikto Tool
1. Nikto is an Open Source software written in Perl language that is used to scan a web-server for the vulnerability that can be exploited and can compromise the server. 
2. It can also check for outdated version details of 1200 server and can detect problems with specific version details of over 200 servers. 
3. It can also fingerprint server using favicon.ico files present in the server. It is not designed to be a particularly a stealth tool rather than it is designed to be fast and time-efficient to achieve the task in very little time. Because of this, a web admin can easily detect that its server is being scanned by looking into the log files.
